Collated Feedback - Dojo #1

Challenge: http://kata-log.rocks/fizz-buzz-kata

## Keyboard switching
It was interesting to work in the classical model.
We discussed the possibility of Mob Programming or Multiple pairs working in the same problem individually.

## Setup
The idea is to keep the bare minimum of setup before starting, this allows the group to reflect on what's really required when developing a solution.

## Constraints
It would be interesting to work with some constraints in other sessions. e.g.: Haskell only, no IFs, max cyclomatic complexity of 2

## Challenge level
While this one was perfect to get us started, it would be nice to have a more challenging next time. Or the same with a completely different language.

## Solution
https://github.com/lcustodio/dojo-fizz-buzz
The solution was based on the remainder of 3, 5 and 15.
In the beginning, we had lots of mutation and after refactoring, we removed the mutation, however, introduced multiple ifs.
